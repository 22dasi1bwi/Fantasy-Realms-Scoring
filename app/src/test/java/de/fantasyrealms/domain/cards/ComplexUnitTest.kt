 * In these cases, first decide what the Doppelg√§nger, Mirage, and Shapeshifter
 * are, in that order. Then use the Book of Changes. Then follow any instructions
 * which call for the clearing of a penalty or part of a penalty. Finally, apply all
 * penalties, beginning with cards not blanked by any other cards.

     * Lands), a Wildfire (blanks Lands), and Cavern (clears penalties on Weather). The
     * Cavern clears the penalty from the Blizzard first. Since the penalty is cleared, the Great
     * Flood is unaffected by the Blizzard, so it quenches the Wildfire and drowns the Cavern.
     * However, even though they are blanked, the Cavern still has successfully cleared the
     * Blizzard penalty. The active cards in the hand are the Blizzard and the Flood.
